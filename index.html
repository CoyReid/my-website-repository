      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Coy Reid, an aspiring Software Developer. I am starting the Flatiron Software Engineering Live program on July 19th, 2021. 
          With no prior experience in programming or the tech industry, this website was created using the skills I learned through the Prework course. 
          In this course I learned the basics of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this website you will find out many things about me, including a little about my past, two of my major interests, and my professional experience. 
          I hope you enjoy and feel free to contact me down below!
