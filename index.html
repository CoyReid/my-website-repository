      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Coy Reid, an aspiring Software Developer. I am starting the Flatiron Software Engineering Live program on July 19th, 2021. 
          With no prior experience in programming or the tech industry, this website was created using the skills I learned through the Prework course. 
          In this course I learned the basics of using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this website you will find out many things about me, including a little about my past, two of my major interests, and my professional experience. 
          I hope you enjoy and feel free to contact me down below!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div id="about-me">
          <img id="sax-pic" src="sax-pic.jpg" alt="profile picture of me with my saxophone">
          <p>
            I am from Austin, Texas and currently still live there. I had the privilege to go through grade school in a well-established school district in North Austin. 
            While there I took an interest in playing competitive sports, joined the band program, and spent multiple hours a day playing computer games.
          </p> 
          <p>
            After graduating High School I decided to pursue a musical career by auditioning for and attending the School of Music at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. 
            While there I honed my skills as a classical saxophone performer and worked towards a major in Music Studies, with a focus on E-12 Music Education.
            I finished my degree in Spring 2019 but had a change of heart when it came to teaching. Instead, I focused on furthering my performance career by auditioning for various Military Ensembles. 
            With the impact of COVID-19, unfortunately I was unable to get my musical career off the ground. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            During the later months of 2020 I made the decision to switch career paths and enter the tech industry. 
            I have multiple colleagues/friends from college who have either been in the computer science field already or made the switch just as I plan on doing. 
            Seeing them succeed has greatly inspired me for this change.
            After consulting with my brother, who’s been programming for 10 years, I reviewed the coding bootcamps available in Austin and online. 
            We came to the conclusion that Flatiron would give me the best chance at making this career change, so I began studying and going through as many free resources on the internet I could find. 
            I’m excited to begin the Software Engineering Live Program and learn the skills/tools I’ll need to land an entry level job and begin my career in the world of programming!
